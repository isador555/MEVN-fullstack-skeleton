"# MEVN-fullstack-skeleton" 

Hello!

This is a simple fullstack app which uses MEVN (MongoDB, Express.js, VueJS and Node.js).
It was made with the help of this tutorial: https://medium.com/@anaida07/mevn-stack-application-part-1-3a27b61dcae0

In order to run the app, open the command line and run "npm run dev" from the "client" folder and run "npm start" from the "server" folder. This will boot up the frontend and backend respectively. 
The frontend will run on localhost:8080 and the backend on localhost:8081.
